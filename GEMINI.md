# AI-DLC and Spec-Driven Development

Kiro-style Spec Driven Development implementation on AI-DLC (AI Development Life Cycle)

## Project Context

### Paths
- Steering: `.kiro/steering/`
- Specs: `.kiro/specs/`

### Steering vs Specification

**Steering** (`.kiro/steering/`) - Guide AI with project-wide rules and context
**Specs** (`.kiro/specs/`) - Formalize development process for individual features

### Active Specifications
- Check `.kiro/specs/` for active specifications
- Use `/kiro:spec-status [feature-name]` to check progress

## Development Guidelines
- Think in English, generate responses in Japanese. All Markdown content written to project files (e.g., requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md, research.md, validation reports) MUST be written in the target language configured for this specification (see spec.json.language).

## Minimal Workflow
- Phase 0 (optional): `/kiro:steering`, `/kiro:steering-custom`
- Phase 1 (Specification):
  - `/kiro:spec-init "description"`
  - `/kiro:spec-requirements {feature}`
  - `/kiro:validate-gap {feature}` (optional: for existing codebase)
  - `/kiro:spec-design {feature} [-y]`
  - `/kiro:validate-design {feature}` (optional: design review)
  - `/kiro:spec-tasks {feature} [-y]`
- Phase 2 (Implementation): `/kiro:spec-impl {feature} [tasks]`
  - `/kiro:validate-impl {feature}` (optional: after implementation)
- Progress check: `/kiro:spec-status {feature}` (use anytime)

## Development Rules
- 3-phase approval workflow: Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation
- Human review required each phase; use `-y` only for intentional fast-track
- Keep steering current and verify alignment with `/kiro:spec-status`
- Follow the user's instructions precisely, and within that scope act autonomously: gather the necessary context and complete the requested work end-to-end in this run, asking questions only when essential information is missing or the instructions are critically ambiguous.
- In Japanese documentation, always insert a half-width space between an English word and the following Japanese text (e.g., `Archive 属性`, `Read-only 属性`; never `Archive属性`, `Read-only属性`).
- When committing, strictly follow the "Conventional Commits" format (e.g., `feat: ...`, `docs(specs): ...`, `chore: ...`) using Japanese for the title summary and the optional body describing the purpose and intent, and do not commit autonomously but only upon explicit human instruction, executing the commit solely on the changes currently staged by the user, and include a brief Japanese body describing the intent and purpose based on the prior conversation.

## Steering Configuration
- Load entire `.kiro/steering/` as project memory
- Default files: `product.md`, `tech.md`, `structure.md`
- Custom files are supported (managed via `/kiro:steering-custom`)
